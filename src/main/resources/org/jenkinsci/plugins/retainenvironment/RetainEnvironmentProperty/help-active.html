    Environment Retainer will store your environment across build steps, including post build steps.<br> To achieve this
    the environment is saved in a file between build steps, the file is stored in a user specified path and the file is
    named 'jobName-buildNumber'.<br>
    To save the environment simply save the variables you want as key value pairs, separated by "=", in the retainer
    file which can be found in the $ENVFILE variable.

    <pre>
        <b>An example:</b>
        env > $ENVFILE
    </pre>
    <pre>
        <b>Another example:</b>
        KEY="myKey"
        VALUE=`myExecutable`
        echo $KEY=$VALUE > $ENVFILE
    </pre>
